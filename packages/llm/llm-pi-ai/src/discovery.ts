/**
 * Answering "which models can this provider serve?" for the configuration
 * surface's "fetch available models" action.
 *
 * A route the installed pi-ai catalog ships answers from that catalog first:
 * pi-ai's registry is the authoritative list for its own providers, and it
 * carries the capacities a listing endpoint would not disclose. Then a live
 * source is consulted and any ids the catalog does not describe are appended
 * as extra candidates, so a provider's newest release is adoptable before the
 * installed pi-ai catches up. Which live source depends on the route: a draft
 * or catalog endpoint speaking an OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic Messages, or
 * Google generative protocol is read through its native listing; the Codex
 * route is read through the Codex backend's own `/models` with the ChatGPT
 * grant. A probe that fails for
 * any reason falls back to the catalog rather than denying the user the rows
 * that are known to exist. Only a route the catalog does not describe — a
 * gateway, a self-hosted server — is interrogated over the wire alone.
 *
 * No path here is a catalog refresh. Nothing here is stored: the request
 * carries a draft the user is still editing, and the reply is candidate
 * metadata the surface offers for adoption. `settings.yaml` remains the only
 * thing that decides what a route serves.
 *
 * OAuth-only and exotic protocols with no readable listing report that they
 * cannot be interrogated so the surface falls back to hand-entry rather than
 * guessing their response fields.
